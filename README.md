This is the most basic chess engine created using WPF.
I managed to create one mostly by myself with a few code optimizations by DeepSeek.
Everything works with the help of lists 'cause I'm still not good at using dictionaries, trees and other advanced data structures in my algorithms.
This chess engine doesn't allow you to do checks and checkmates.
I'll ask DeepSeek to rewrite the logic for easier implementation of checks and checkmates.
